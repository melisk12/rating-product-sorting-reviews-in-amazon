# Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon

## Business Problem
One of the most significant problems in e-commerce is the accurate calculation of post-purchase ratings for products. Solving this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, highlighting products for sellers, and ensuring a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Another problem is the accurate sorting of product reviews. Since the prominence of misleading reviews can directly impact product sales, it can result in both financial losses and customer churn. After resolving these two core problems, the e-commerce site and sellers will increase their sales, while customers will be able to complete their purchase journey seamlessly.
